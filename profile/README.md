# CKDFree

A mobile app and dashboard for effective management of early-stage chronic kidney disease.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health issue and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. People in the lowest socioeconomic quartile have a 60% higher risk of progressive CKD. This is because CKD is also mostly asymptomatic in early stages and is a reason for missed opportunity to delay progression and provide intervention.

This project aims to develop a mobile app that early detects individuals who are at risk of deterioration in their renal function and needing intervention. It will also involve developing a web dashboard to summarise and integrate key health information to detect abnormal signs/activities and alert to patients and clinicians. Through this, it will provide monitoring and appropriate education to those who are progressing steadily.

This project's goals are:

1. The development of app and dashboard will improve the management of CKD patients in rural and remote areas for better health outcomes and planning
2. It will also improve access to specialised CKD services: Access is a major issue for CKD management in all settings, most pronounced in rural and remote areas and is addressed by this study
3. Enable better patient education, self-management, peer-support, and use of community resources
